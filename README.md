# 05-Third-Party-APIs

Use the provided framework to add in the script to match the gif mock up that was provided. The goal was to have a task track that when you added a task to a block of time you could save it. This saved information would stay with the user as it is stored in local storage. To bring a sense of organization and keep the user on track, the tool uses time to determine when the block of time is future, current, or past by changing the background color.
